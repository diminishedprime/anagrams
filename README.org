* anagrams

anagrams is a simple clojure library designed to give you anagrams for a word,
provided you give it a dictionary of words to choose from.

* Usage
1. First, add anagrams to your dependencies.
   [[https://img.shields.io/clojars/v/anagrams.svg]]

2. Then, require anagrams into your namespace.
   #+BEGIN_SRC clojure
     (ns your-namespace
       (:require [anagrams.core :as anagrams]))

     ;; Set the word list to be used to find anagrams.
     (anagrams/set-word-list! "newline\ndelimeted\nword\nlist") ;; => "done"

     ;; To find anagrams
     (anagrams/anagrams-of "newline") ;; => #{"newline"}

     ;; To append more words to the dictionary
     (anagrams/append-word-list! "more\nawesome\nwords") ;; => "done"

     (anagrams/anagrams-of "rome");; => #{"more"}
   #+END_SRC
